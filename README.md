Wow, just WOW. Squad 36 is like being hit by a freight train full of emotional turbulence, and I'm still spinning like a top on a frozen pond. I can barely hear myself think over the ringing in my ears from that ending explosion. Or was it my phone buzzing? Don’t even know anymore. My back is aching like I just sat through a too-long bus ride, every jolt and twist felt on those ancient seats, and popcorn crumbs have found new homes in the crevices of my shirt. Seriously, it’s an eventually-foreign battlefield in there.    

> Imagine aliens meeting cowboys and they all go salsa dancing on Tinder dates— and that's just the first act. I swear, I was so engrossed that for a moment I forgot I was supposed to dislike the antagonist. They had this weird mullet that reminds me of my cousin's quarantine haircut, but somehow it just added layers?? These characters were like onions wrapped in more onion layers, each reveal a tango into more chaos. Daryl with the laser whip?! Wild stuff.

The cacophony of sound only rivaled by the crowd's whispers and kid kicking my chair three rows behind. It was a live jungle, honestly. Or maybe a very determined game of Jumanji. Our protagonist, Rica—reminds me of a pineapple in the Sahara. It makes sense if you see it... she’s vibrant and sharp but stuck in a place that makes no sense. 

And that soundtrack! It beats like a heart on an energy drink marathon, echoing every emotional wave and then some. I think someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or maybe that was just Matty reminding me to get groceries. Maybe you can 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home, but the theater’s the only place it feels like mountaintop yelling.

> Did I mention the flying car chase yet? Vintage and futuristic at once, like seeing an old computer try to run a new OS. The visuals pretty much gave my retinas a hyper-vivid massage—like rave lights cutting through jello... or something.

At some point, my brain took a detour, and I started wondering if the director has a ferret, because the pacing scampered forward, then paused like it saw something shiny. Moments of pure adrenaline intercut with scenes that felt like waiting in a long queue, but with the perfect tension— not the annoying kind, like when groceries don’t scan right and you just stand there. 

Ah, this is a mess. Anyway, someone said they wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and I’m too wired to remember who. My words are noodle soup, but when you see it you’ll get it.  

Here’s some trailing code:    
```javascript
function unexpectedTwist( , scenes) {
   if (  === Squad 36) {
      var daze = true;
      return scenes.map(chaos => chaos  Math.random());
   }
   return daze;
}
